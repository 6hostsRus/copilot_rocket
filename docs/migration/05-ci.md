# CI: verify Docs→Runtime drift check

Purpose: provide a compact CI job that fails PRs when `.github` drift is detected.

Recommended workflow (agent-can-add-to-repo):

`.github/workflows/verify-runtime.yml` (concise):

```yaml
name: Verify Docs→Runtime
on: [pull_request]
jobs:
  verify:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with: { node-version: '20' }
      - run: npm ci || npm i
      - run: npm run generate
      - name: Drift check
        run: |
          DIFF=$(git diff --name-only .github || true)
          if [ -n "$DIFF" ]; then
            echo "Drift detected in .github:"; echo "$DIFF"; exit 1
          fi
```

Agent task: add this workflow file if the repository does not already contain an equivalent guard.

Acceptance: PRs that touch `docs_base/` or `.github/` will fail CI if `.github` is out-of-date with `docs_base`.
