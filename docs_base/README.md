# docs_base templates

These templates define the core artifacts for the docs-base-bundle.

**Triad Rules** (Scope • Path • Ledger)

- **Scope Card** drives intent and non-goals.
- **Rooted Commands** execute work from the project root with explicit paths.
- **Work Ledger** logs every action (who/what/when/why) and references commit SHAs.

Update these files in your consuming repo, not here in the package.
